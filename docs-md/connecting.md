 * `minConnections` : minimum number of connections to keep in the pool
 
**Note:** All other options will be passed to the underlying driver see the driver documentation for additional options.

//Create a connection to a mysql database at localhost port 3306, with the username test, password test and
// 1 connection by default and a max of 10
var DB = patio.createConnection("mysql://test:testpass@localhost:3306/test?maxConnections=1&minConnections=10");    
```

//connect using an object
var DB = patio.createConnection({
             host : "localhost",
             port : 3306,
             type : "mysql",
             maxConnections : 10,
             minConnections : 1,
             user : "test",
             password : "testpass",
             database : 'test'
});

```

##Disconnecting

To disconnect from a database you can use:

* [patio.disconnect](./patio.html#disconnect) which disconnects all databases currently connected.

```
patio.disconnect().then(function(){
    //all databases are disconnected all queued queries have finished
});
```

* [patio.Database#disconnect](./patio_Database.html#disconnect) which disconnects only that database.

```
DB.disconnect().then(function(){
    //database is disconnected and all queued queries have finished
});
```
